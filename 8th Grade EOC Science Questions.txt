1 Paula discovered three sedimentary rock layers that contain fossils of a lizard
species. The list below shows how Paula described the lizards’ appearance in each

and a bottlenose dolphin.
• Each of the toad’s forelimbs has four fingers. The toad uses its
forelimbs to grasp objects and walk.

7 Permafrost is created when the water in the ground freezes and remains frozen
year-round. Alaska has permafrost that has remained frozen for at least
12,000 years. Scientists have discovered that this permafrost contains powerful
greenhouse gases, and the permafrost releases these gases to the atmosphere
as it melts. What relationship might exist between global climate change and this
permafrost?
 A Increasing air temperatures will cause more permafrost to melt, and then
 more greenhouse gases will be released into the atmosphere.
 B Increasing air temperatures will cause less permafrost to melt, and then
 fewer greenhouse gases will be released into the atmosphere.
 C The permafrost will cause global air temperatures to decrease, and then
 more greenhouse gases will get trapped in the permafrost.
 D The permafrost will cause global air temperatures to increase, and then

Jody learns about the composition of each rock type. She ranks the hardness of each
rock type on a scale of 1 to 3, where 1 is the softest rock, and 3 is the hardest. The
chemical composition and relative hardness of each rock type are shown below in

A species of land iguana also exists on the Galapagos Islands and other places on
Earth. Scientists think that the marine iguana and the land iguana share a

Calm Lake Investigation
Xavier lives near Calm Lake. One summer, he notices the lake appears darker than it
has in the past. Xavier finds a news article claiming that nutrient pollution has caused
the change in the water’s color.
Xavier wants to learn more about nutrient pollution. He finds a diagram on the U.S.
Geological Survey’s website that shows how phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) contribute
to nutrient pollution. Figure 1 shows the diagram.

Xavier wonders how nutrient pollution may have changed the water quality. He contacts
a scientist who has been studying algae in Calm Lake. The scientist explains that the
algae are photosynthetic. The list below describes how the scientist measures the algae
content in the lake.
• He collects a 1-liter water sample from the lake.
• He filters the algae from the water.
• He removes the chlorophyll contained in each alga cell using a

dissolved oxygen content. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the two sets of measurements.

34 Scientists used atmospheric temperature data from 1901 to 2000 and determined
that the average global temperature, over both land and ocean, in the month

average April temperature to 13.7°C. The graph below is a collection of these
measurements from 1960 to 2023. In the graph, a positive temperature
measurement indicates that April of that year was warmer than 13.7°C. A
negative measurement indicates it was colder than 13.7°C.
 Which choice is the best interpretation of the graph?
