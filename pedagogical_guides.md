Topic: Weather Patterns
Options: *Recent temperatures are significantly lower than average, Recent temperatures are higher than average, The season is changing from winter to spring, The thermometer is broken
Explanation: Look at the numbers. 65°F is much lower than the average of 85°F. What does 'Average' mean in weather terms?
Analogy: If you usually get 85 on tests, but this week you got 65s, are your grades higher or lower than your normal?

Explanation: What does 'Low Pressure' usually bring? Think 'L' for Low and 'L' for Lousy weather.

Topic: Nutrient Pollution
Options: *Fertilizer runoff from nearby farms, Acid rain, Thermal pollution from factories, Volcanic activity
Explanation: Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) are the main ingredients in plant food (fertilizer). Rain washes them into the water.
Analogy: Think of giving a plant too much Miracle-Gro. It grows crazy fast! The same happens to algae.

Topic: Algae Bloom & Oxygen
Options: *The algae population increased giving them less light, The algae stopped photosynthesizing, The fish ate all the algae
Explanation: Wait, check the data! Algae goes UP. Oxygen stays high for a bit, then crashes. Why? When different organisms die, bacteria eat them and use up the oxygen.
Analogy: It's like a crowded party in a small room. At first it's fun, but eventually, everyone uses up the air.

Question: How do algae usually contribute to the matter cycle in a healthy lake (before the pollution)?
Topic: Photosynthesis
Options: *Produce Oxygen (O2) and food, Produce Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Consume Oxygen only
Explanation: Algae are plants! What do plants do? They take sunlight and make food + oxygen.

Question: Which major ocean current transports warm water from the Gulf of Mexico along the eastern coast of the United States, influencing the climate?
Options: *The Gulf Stream, The Jet Stream, The California Current, Le Niño
Explanation: The name gives a clue! It comes from the "Gulf".

Options: *The fox population will decrease due to lack of food, The fox population will increase due to more space, The fox population will eat the grass instead, There will be no change in the fox population
Explanation: If the "food" at the bottom disappears, what happens to the animals that eat it?
Analogy: If the grocery store closes, people get hungry.

Question: What is the primary role of decomposers, such as mushrooms and bacteria, in an ecosystem?
Options: *To break down dead matter and return nutrients to the soil, To produce energy directly from sunlight, To hunt small insects for food, To provide shelter for other organisms
